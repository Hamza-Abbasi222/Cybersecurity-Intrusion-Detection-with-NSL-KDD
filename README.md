Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection with NSL-KDD: Comparative Analysis of DNN, XGBoost, and Ensemble Models
Explore a comprehensive analysis of intrusion detection in cybersecurity using the NSL-KDD dataset. This project applies various machine learning algorithms, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), XGBoost, Navie Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), and an Ensemble model (Ensemble SGBoost). Among these models, the ensemble approach, combining the strengths of individual algorithms, yielded the most robust results in classifying network traffic into distinct attack types: Normal, DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R. Dive into the findings and insights derived from this comparative analysis, shedding light on effective intrusion detection strategies for cybersecurity enhancement.
